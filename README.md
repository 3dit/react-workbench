### react-workbench

This is a simple react excercise in react routing and implemntation of a simple to-do list and a 'player calculator' board game transaction tool.

This simple react application using only react (w/o redux) is meant for react exercise

Requires webpack-dev-server (I prefer globally) installed:

    $ npm install -g webpack-dev-server

Install npm packages:
    
    $ npm install

    - or using yarn -

    $ yarn

Then build:

    $ npm run-script build

    - or using yarn -

    $ yarn run build

This will create the dist/index_bundle.js bundle which allows you to run the application:

    $ webpack-dev-server

Point browser to localhost:8080

Pending: hot module reload
